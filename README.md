dotfiles
========

My various config files.

A decent amount of what's here is copied from
https://github.com/treed/dotfiles , although my vim config is
extremely idiosyncratic, based on tabs kind of like tmux windows;
see https://www.dropbox.com/s/wpncssh1abj9ocr/vim_workflow.txt
for some minor explanation there.

Test ignore: [http://google.com/] test.
