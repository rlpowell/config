# Note that saving to Trash immediately, forcefully, deletes the message from
# the inbox; this causes a "Mailbox was externally modified.  Flags
# may be wrong." message, and often causes the cursor to go
# somewhere weird.  This does not seem to be fixable, although you
# could add <last-entry> or something to these macros and at least
# end up in a predictable place.
