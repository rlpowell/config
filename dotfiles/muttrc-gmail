# somewhere weird.  This does not seem to be fixable, although you
# could add <last-entry> or something to these macros and at least
# end up in a predictable place.

# I don't use labels basically ever, so by default save just means

# Saved label has the added bonus of meaning "I explicitely decided
# to save this", but there are alternative ways to handle this
# commented out below.

# Also, this goes *after* the local stuff as it's the "only if
